    "### Introduction of the dataset and report\n",
    "This is the prelimminary report for the course Data Analysis in Summer 2019 presented by Genevieve Plante-Brisebois. The dataset that is chosen to do the project is Google Play Store Apps taken from this website: https://www.kaggle.com/lava18/google-play-store-apps . The information in this dataset covers each app in respect with their name, rating, reviews, number of downloads, type, price, file size, content rating, genres, last version/update made, current version and the android version needed in order to run the apps. The dataset contains 9660 records. It is comprised of the csv document for the general information of the applications as described above and a csv document comprised of the reviews and given ratings to the applications. The Review csv is taking the top 100 reviews from each application which has received reviews. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using these datasets, there are multiple questions that I will attempt to answer and, as the answers are found, they will become the basis for the next one. This will be done in three stages. \n",
    "\n",
    "1- What is more popular and fruitfull between free and paid applications and predict the present and upcoming trend?\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer that question I will be making exploratory analysis of the data. I will be taking a look at the data and compare the number of downloads of each application and then try to see what is the one coming up on top in terms of poopularity by combining with the ratings. \n",
    "\n",
    "For an information purpose, the revenue of the paid apps will be calculated as it could help to see if it is profitable. However, it is impossible to get the information about the revenue for the free applications. If it would be possible to find the data of the revenue from the free applications with the adds it would be a good way to enrich the dataset and add another feature to analyse the set. \n",
    "\n",
    "2- What are the rising trends in the app type that will have won the previous question?\n",
    "\n",
    "This will try to answer if there are categories and target audiences that are more proeminent and are the trend or upcomming trends. This will again be done by doing exploratory data analysis. Just like with the previous question, it will be used to narrow down the amount of data that will be used in the next step. By further narowing our criterias, we will be able to bring ourselves to the last step of this process. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3- Predict the impact of the reviews and rating on the number of downloads. \n",
    "\n",
    "From the selected apps in the previous questions, we will take a look at the reviews dataset. Using exploratory data analysis and natural language processing, we will try to create new feature that will hopefully allow us to see if there is a link between the reviews, the ratings and the success of an application in the trending categories. The success we are looking at for the apps in this case is the number of downloads. From the information found here we will try to predict the influence and potentially the growth of the applications that are present in these categories."

    "1-Go to the www.kaggle.com website and create an account if you do not have one yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "2-Then there will be a need to go to the  https://www.kaggle.com/lava18/google-play-store-apps page and click on the download button at the top of the page. If you desire to have more information about the data set, you can read the page and see the information and summary that has been provided for this data set. \n",
    "\n",
    "3- Make sure that you are creating a data folder where you are having the jupyter book and in that data folder extract all the concerned information that is in the zip folder.  You should be able to have the googleplaystore.csv and the googleplaystore_user_reviews.csv file. \n",
